# DataScience - Projects
Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository! This repository contains various data science projects I have worked on, covering a wide range of topics, including machine learning, deep learning, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Each project is aimed at solving real-world problems using different datasets, algorithms, and tools.

Feel free to explore the projects, review the code, and learn from the results.
